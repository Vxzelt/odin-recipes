    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul><strong>*It is not necessary to follow the recipe to the letter, if you do not have an ingredient, replace it with whatever you have on hand.</strong>
            <li>12 ounces bow tie pasta</li>
                <br>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
                <br>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) package smoked sausage, cut into 1/2-inch thick slices</li>
                <br>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) frozen seasoning blend</li>
                <br>
            <li>1 teaspoon Cajun seasoning, or more to taste</li>
                <br>
            <li>1 1/2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <br>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook bow tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water when draining.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large deep skillet over medium-low heat. Add sausage and cook, stirring occasionally, until fat is rendered and sausage is browned, about 3 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high; add seasoning blend and Cajun seasoning and cook until vegetables are softened, about 4 minutes.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Stir in heavy cream and bring to a simmer.  Cook, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened.</li>
                <br>
            <li>Stir in cooked pasta and Parmesan cheese; cook, stirring constantly, until everything is well incorporated. Add reserved pasta water as needed to loosen the mixture. Garnish with chopped fresh parsley if desired and serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
